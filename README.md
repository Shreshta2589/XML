# XML

Objectives
• Become familiar with the DOM paradigm;
• Use an existing XML parser;
• Transform the content of an XML document into an HTML page.

Need to write a HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of an XML document containing US Airlines information, parses the XML file, and extracts the list of airlines, displaying them in a table. 
The JavaScript program will be embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser.
